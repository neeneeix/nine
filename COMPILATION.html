                    <p align="center" style="color:#454854;">Before the year ended.. after a year's worth of debating I got my first break. Honestly a shocker, still remember crying over it. LPSCI's first debate novice semifinalist awardee!!</p>

                    <p align="center" style="color:#454854;">Hey! My first event hosting. We did the Grade 9-10 English debate.. that took a lot of time and planning.. and left us with a lot of backlogs. BUT BUT BUT, VERY FUN! I am truly very thankful to Ms Gia and Ms Bianca for trusting us with the responsibility huhu.</p>

                    <p align="center" style="color:#454854;">And then, the real fun (4th Quarter) begins.<br><br>Sadly, I came into this quarter not expecting much as... well the contests I was supposed to have were cancelled as sad as it was. But, I put myself in some cool inter-school events!</p>
                    <br><br><br>

                    <p align="center" style="color:#454854;">Very timely after card giving, streetdance! Our class alongside Fidelity won I believe third (?)</p>

                    <p align="center" style="color:#454854;">COMEA. I am so so grateful for the experience in COMEA. Randomly being put as COMEA secretary too huhu.. I did room to room, typed out official documents.. did the voting (nagsaway sa mga grade 8s "COMMON SENSE YAN"), folded, cut and counted 400+ ballots and met some truly wonderful people. I saw the background of it all and I am grateful for this (actually) eye-opening experience. <i>(Since we weren't allowed to show COMEA stuff this is the only photo I really have.. sorry Kuya Lance TT) </i></p>
